# Home Assignment 2

The project displays 4 options to user and asks for user input based on action it wants to perform. The input asked can be - price of car, make, model name, number of years or year. 

Based on input provided by user, the code filters the cars from the list and prints to .txt file with names :

ListofCars.txt —> list of cars of specific make entered by user

List_by_price.txt —> list of cars of same year and price greater than entered by user.

List_by_year.txt —> list of cars of same model which have been in use for more than year as entered by user

It creates a new ‘.txt’ file if the file is not already present.
